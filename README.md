At a function I tell people that my field of study is information systems with a focused view on data analysis. After I graduate I want to start out as a data analyst and move up the chain to become a project manager. 

# Ryan Activities

During my free time I enjoy playing soccer with friends. I also enjoy working out as it helps me get my mind off of things and it is good for you. I work for Kingland Systems as a data analyst intern, in the summer I will be working des moines as a data analyst for the Waldinger Corporation.

# Ryan tools to organizing

I utulize google calendar to help me schedule my day from the morning to the night. I would not be able to excel in class without having a semi strict schedule. I try and prepare for exams at least three days in advance depending on the class and work load that I have. AS well taking diligent notes during class to help me understand the material.
